# Note!!!!
Unfortunately due to multiple occasions since I made this project, I have unfortunately reset my computer and lost all files. This project was a class project in my Big Data Engineering class that I took in which I'm personally very proud of this project even though it's not big or very exciting. I enjoy statistics in this case so it is very exciting to see for me personally.  


## Background
This project takes advantage of cloudlab and pyspark and pyapache. I took hundreds of GB's of Ice Hockey data in which it was spread across multiple computers on cloudlab to be able to be processed in milliseconds using a pyspark and pynotebook. The datasetIhnfo-converted.pdf is just the different sections of the notebook. 

## Project1.pdf
This is the actual notebook that was in my project just in pdf form. Here you will see all the code that was used throughout the project and the outputs from each section. I hope you enjoy.
